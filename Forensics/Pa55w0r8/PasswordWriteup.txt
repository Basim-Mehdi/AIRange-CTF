# Writeup: Extracting Wi-Fi Password from .pcap File and Cracking WPA Handshake

### Challenge Summary

You are provided with a `.pcap` file containing 802.11 Wi-Fi packets including a WPA handshake. Your goal is to extract the handshake and recover the Wi-Fi password (which will be your flag).

---

### Step 1: Analyze the Capture File

* The capture file `cap1.pcap` contains over 4000 Wi-Fi packets with deauthentication frames indicating handshake capture attempts.
* Using `aircrack-ng` on the `.pcap` shows the presence of a WPA handshake:


aircrack-ng cap1.pcap


Output indicates:

* BSSID: `96:F3:BA:C7:96:38`
* ESSID (network name): `Test`
* 1 handshake found

---

### Step 2: Crack the WPA Handshake Password

* The handshake is ready for cracking.
* Use a commonly available password list, such as `rockyou.txt`:


aircrack-ng -w /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt cap1.pcap


* This runs a dictionary attack testing millions of passwords against the handshake.

---

### Step 3: Retrieve the Password

* After running the above command, the key was found:

```
KEY FOUND! [ 11223344 ]
```

* This is the Wi-Fi password.

---

### Step 4: Format the Flag

* Given the challenge flag format: `flag{password}`
* The final flag is:

```
flag{11223344}
```
